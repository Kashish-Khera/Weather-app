# Weather-app
Weather app 
Its a weather application which shows the current weather depending upon the user's geolocation. 
It shows the geolocation of the user along with the description of the weather with the weather icon .
It also shows the  temprature  both  in Celcius and Fahrenheit . It also shows the sunrise and sunset time.
I used OpenWeatherMAP api to fetch the data .To get user's currentlocation i used geolocation property of navigator object . 
I used fetch () method which enables us to call and get data from API services.We get the data in JSON format .
I converted  it into JSON object and extract all the values that I needed it from it using Javascript Object Destructing.after geeting all the dtata that i needed , i changed values.
